LOTTERY.py
This algorithm is meant to suggest lottery numbers to be played for the POWERBALL game.  POWERBALL has 69 balls that are drawn 5 at a time per play as of 10/07/2015.  (There is a an extra ball–the "power ball"–between numbers 1 to 26, but we don't consider those in our probabilities; however, the power balls are noted for historical drawings.  You will also see that the multiplier is included as unused data in the powerball.txt file.) The powerball.txt file is a list of historical drawings.  The tickets.txt file is a list of played numbers.  

TICKETS.txt
Is the list of chosen numbers at no specific date.

POWERBALL.txt
Is the list of drawings for the game 5/69 

Assumption vs. Gambler's fallacy
For fair draws, the histogram should be uniform. For an infinite number of draws we approach a uniform distribution. A finite method suggests playing tickets that are under the average tally in the histogram to even out the chart to be uniform.
